                                Before coming to Sweden, during my bachelor's ( BTech in IT),
                                I have worked as a developer in most of my internship projects where my focus was image processing
                                and computer vision. I pursued my bachelor's thesis at the computer science department of IIT Kharagpur
                                where I worked on Counterfeit IC Detection using Image Processing techniques. I am fortunate to gain
                                internship experiences under the supervision of
                                <a href="http://home.iitk.ac.in/~venkats/">Prof K. S. Venkates </a> (IIT Kanpur),

                                (IIT Kharagpur)
                                <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~sdas/">Prof. Sukhendu Das</a> (IIT Madras),

                                These experiences strengthened my skills as a developer which now helps me to understand development
                                feasibility while designing solutions as a user researcher.

            I am a virtual intern under
          <a href="http://empathiccomputing.org/team/mark-billinghurst/">Prof Mark Billinghurst</a>
          for 2022 spring. I have
            worked at Ericsson Research recently as an R&D intern during summer 2021 where I investigated on effects of
            Latency on Haptic Teleoperation. Currently, for my semester project at EPFL, I am working under
           <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/ronan.boulic">Dr. Ronan Boulic</a>
          where I am making effort to recognize facial expressions in
            Virtual Reality. I was a volunteer at HackZurich 2021 and I am a member of the KTH AI Society Education Team.
